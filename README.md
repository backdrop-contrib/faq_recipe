FAQ Recipe
======================

This module is a simple config recipe developed to help illustrated what can
be done with a module that only contains config files and CSS. 

This recipe creates

 - A FAQ content type
 - A view using Bootstrap Accordion module to display FAQs. 
   Bootstrap Accordion module must be enabled and configured to 
   "Include Bootstrap CSS & JS when used by Views"
 - A menu item in main menu

 While some users may be happy with the configuration of this FAQ feature 
 exactly as defined in the recipe. We expect that most users will use 
 this recipe as a starting point and customize it to meet their unique needs. 


Requirements

This recipes is currently configured to use the Bootstrap Accordion module 
to display the FAQ. You will need to enable and configure the Bootstrap 
Accordion module.
